A 25-year-old healthy male student and part-time postman presents with sharp, brief chest pains centered over his heart, lasting a few seconds, occurring over the past three days. The pain worsens with coughing or lying down and improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and sometimes it radiates to his neck. He denies shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or other symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu but currently has no viral symptoms. No past medical conditions, medications except occasional Tylenol, no allergies, surgeries, or recreational drug use. Family history is significant for his father’s recent fatal heart attack two weeks ago. He expresses fear that he may be having a heart attack. Physical and social history is otherwise unremarkable, with occasional alcohol use and no smoking. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his heart and advises him not to worry excessively while awaiting results.
