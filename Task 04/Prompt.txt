You've submitted code for review and received feedback that seems superficial. 
You need to get a deeper analysis of your code from different perspectives.
Your task is to follow these instructions:

1. Define Expert Roles and Analysis Focus 
- Following three expert personas sequentially, providing an analysis from each viewpoint. 
- The focus areas for each role should be as an Experienced Developer,  a Security Engineer, and a Performance Specialist.

2. Take the provided code snippet as input.

3. Analyze it from each of the three specified expert perspectives (Developer, Security Engineer, Performance Specialist).

4. For each perspective, provide specific, actionable recommendations and observations to improve the code.

Here is the code:
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
