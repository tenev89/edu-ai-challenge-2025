Here is the structured JSON analysis for both feedback samples using the same reasoning and structure as the provided examples:

---

### **Sample 1:**

> "Sensor just stops tracking for like a half second kinda often even at 8000hz. I've also tried it plugged in and still the same problem. First one I got I had to return also because the dongle just didnt work, \$150 mouse btw"

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

* This is clearly relevant to the product.
* The feedback highlights two recurring technical issues: sensor tracking dropouts and dongle malfunction.
* No positives are mentioned.
* The tone is negative and suggests dissatisfaction, especially with the price point relative to performance.
* The user is familiar with advanced settings (8000hz, wired mode), indicating experience.

```json
{
  "sentiment": "Negative",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Sensor tracking issues and hardware reliability",
  "positives": [],
  "painPoints": [
    "Sensor stops tracking intermittently",
    "Issue persists even when wired",
    "Initial dongle was non-functional",
    "High cost not justified by performance"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Fix sensor tracking stability at high polling rates",
    "Improve wireless dongle reliability",
    "Ensure quality control for hardware out-of-box"
  ],
  "featuresMentioned": [
    "Sensor",
    "Polling rate (8000hz)",
    "Dongle",
    "Connectivity (wired/wireless)",
    "Price"
  ],
  "userExpertise": "Experienced"
}
```

### **Sample 2:**

> "Is it worth it? It is a product with no flaws in my opinion, if you love it go for it, but its not worth the price since you'll be able to perform the same with a cheaper product with half the specs."

**Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:**

* The comment is relevant and addresses the product.
* It contains both praise and criticism — the user finds no functional flaws but criticizes the price-to-performance ratio.
* The sentiment is **mixed**, leaning neutral but critical on pricing.
* Suggests that high specs do not yield better performance for the user, implying they may not value premium specs.
* No signs of advanced or technical expertise.

```json
{
  "sentiment": "Mixed",
  "isRelevant": true,
  "mainSubject": "Price-to-performance value",
  "positives": [
    "Product has no functional flaws (in user’s opinion)"
  ],
  "painPoints": [
    "Price not justified by performance compared to cheaper alternatives"
  ],
  "improvementSuggestions": [
    "Reconsider pricing strategy for better value perception"
  ],
