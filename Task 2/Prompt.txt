You're in the middle of QA or development and come across a bug. 
You wrote down a quick note like: “Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”

This kind of informal note is common—but it's not enough for a developer to take action quickly.

Design a prompt that converts informal bug reports like the one provided above into a clear, well-structured bug ticket. 

The output should follow this format:
1.Title
2.Description
3.Steps to Reproduce
4.Expected vs Actual Behavior
5.Environment (if known)
6.Severity or Impact
